I could not find any models that try to predict regular season games (most focus on the playoffs which are significantly more predictable). But we can do some assessment!\nDoes the model improve on the floor accuracy?  \n1) The model is better than the baseline ✅  \n2) The model is better than simple ELO based predictions ✅\n\n**How high is the accuracy ceiling?**  \nThe easiest answer to this question is that an all omnicient being can predict with 100% accuracy and therefore that is the ceiling. A more realistic answer would be to try to see *how much inherent unpredictability is there in the NBA*.  \nThe most reliable source of data I could find for this is this perfectly named paper [Luck is hard to beat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02447.pdf). The researchers performed an analysis accross all sports to try and understand to what extent does luck play a role in the results.  \nFor basketball the skill coefficient is pretty high as it is a high scoring game which gives plenty of opportunity for the highly skilled teams to shine. They did however perform an analysis accross the NBA regular season to see **how often an underdog wins the game**. The figure they came up with (average accross seasons 2012-2016) is **around 36% of the time**. This gives us a figure of roughly speaking the unpredictability of the regular season.  \nPlease note that despite the analysis in this paper, there are always improvements to be made in any prediction algorithm!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Lessons learnt\n\nAnalysing and working with this dataset took quite a while and resulted in many (but really many!😂) unsuccessful attempts.
